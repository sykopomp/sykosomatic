* Grammer/Spealing erarrs
  People misspell what they say, and sometimes they want to correct it. The coughing trick receives
  poor reviews. Bavardage suggests actually correcting corrections inline. Apparently, Skype does
  it.
* Emphasis?
  F wants to have italics to emphasize phrases, instead of using *foo*/-foo-/_foo_
* Parentheticals vs Action
  There's a tension between standalone actions, and what goes in (parentheticals). Some kind of rule
  of how actions are parsed into parentheticals vs actions might be nice.
* Action/Dialogue grouping
  It would be nice if actions and dialogue were automatically grouped if said in direct sequence by
  the same character.
* Writing quality
  Writing quality is a concern. Does it help that the parser handles most of it?
